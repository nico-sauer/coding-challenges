Shopping during the sales can sometimes be very confusing. With discounted prices at 10%, 20%, 50% or even 70%!

For this challenge you are going to write a Python script that prompts the user to enter a price in pounds (or in your own currency) (e.g. Â£90) and a discount rate to apply (e.g. 20%).

Your program will then calculate and display the discounted price.
